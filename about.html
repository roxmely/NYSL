        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>
          The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide
          athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhood an environment
          to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be between
          the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL
          is run by a small, full-time staff, and relies on the generous
          volunteer time of parents and former league members.
