        <div class="sport">
          <ul>
            <li>
              The common interest that members of the Association share is to
              inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
              play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or
              referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to
              disciplinary action regardless of technical soccer background,
              expertise, accomplishments or standing.

            <li>
              <span class="bold">DIMENSIONS.</span>
              FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within
              a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions
              should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and
              older.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="bold">COMPETITION FIELDS.</span> Fields used within
              the competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.
              Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state
              competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets
              these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board
              which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and
              recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
              dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
              associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
              required to play all their games away.

                  U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no
                  penalty areas. Fields for older age groups should be
                  progressively larger.
                </li>
                <li>
                  U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards
                  width.

                    The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
                    be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s bench
                    area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard away
                    from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20) both
                    ways from the halfway line. In the event that field 2
                    conditions require team benches to be on the same side of
                    the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area
                    two (2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty

                    to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
                    and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
                    the team they are supporting.

                  from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards from

              Except as noted below, team rosters shall consist of not less than

              In order to give player’s maximum opportunity to develop in the

              roster as stated in United States Youth Soccer Association (USYSA)
              rules. It is strongly recommended that U-6 and U-8 play 4 v 4.
              UYSA shall not sanction games involving teams under 10 or younger
              unless such games are conducted with not more than eight (8)
              players per side. (National rule 4036 section 2).

            <li>
              Recreational/Developmental players at other ages or where numbers

              Passes of any individual(s) ejected from any match shall be
              retained after the match by the referee. The pass of any
              individual who has received a third caution (yellow card) during a
              playing year shall be confiscated by the referee at the conclusion
              of the match in which the third caution was received. That player
              will be suspended from playing in the next game in which the
              offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
              This process will continue so that for every third yellow card
              received during a playing year, the player will be suspended from
              playing in the next game (after the receipt of a third yellow
              card) for which the offending participate would otherwise be
              eligible to participate. The referee shall deliver all confiscated
              passes to the UYSA State Office within forty-eight (48) hours of
